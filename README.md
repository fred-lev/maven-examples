# maven-examples

This is a fork of [maven-examples](https://github.com/pkainulainen/maven-examples) created by [Petri Kainulainen](https://github.com/pkainulainen).

I mostly used the app code to get familiar with running Jacoco in Jenkins, generate tests coverage reports.

This repo is also use in // with SonarQube to scan the code and push reports to my org at [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/)
