# maven-examples

This is a fork of [maven-examples](https://github.com/pkainulainen/maven-examples) created by [Petri Kainulainen](https://github.com/pkainulainen).

I mostly used the application code here to get familiar with running Jacoco in Jenkins and generating tests coverage reports.

SonarQube is also used to scan the application code and push reports to my org at [sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io/).
